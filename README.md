Pandas Challenge

### Description

This script takes data from two csv's: "schools_complet.csv" and "students_complete.csv", and generates a series of summary tables to analyze the data. The goal of the analyis is to measure school/student performance based on multiple factors.

The code and analysis of the data is located in the file "PyCitySchools_analysis.ipynb" inside the "PyCitySchools" folder. The csv's are located within the "Resources" folder.

    This sources wasz used to join multiple tables into one to form cohesive summary tables

- Structure and organization of the "PyCitySchools_analysis.ipynb" file was formatted based on the starter code provided with this assignment.
